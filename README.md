#Dotfiles

These are the various configuration files which I like to use. Much of
this is just a selection of Emacs extensions/plugins. It also contains
my set of ZSH configurations files, largely based off of
[zprezto](https://github.com/altV/zprezto) but with a few changes to
suit my preferences. 

You can automatically put everything in the right place/set it all up
by running

    ./setup.sh

However, I take no responsibility if this completely destroys your
system, deletes, or overwrites something that shouldn't be.
